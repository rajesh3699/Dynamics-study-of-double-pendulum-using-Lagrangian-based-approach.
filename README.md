# Dynamic study of double pendulum using Lagrangian based approach.
The inspiration behind this was to learn Lagrangian, using the former derive dynamic model of double pendulum and simulate it.

# Derivation of dynamics
The derivation of the dynamics is [here](https://github.com/rajesh3699/Dynamics-study-of-double-pendulum-using-Lagrangian-based-approach./blob/master/Snake%20dynamics%20lagrangian%20approach%20(1).pdf)



# Future work
Solving the differential equations using various iterative numerical methods and thereby comparing results by simulating.
