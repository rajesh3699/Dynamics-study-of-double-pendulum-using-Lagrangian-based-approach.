# Dynamic study of double pendulum using Lagrangian based approach.
The inspiration behind this was to learn Lagrangian, using the former derive dynamic model of double pendulum and simulate it.

The angle wrt to the horizontal was found out using MPU 9250 by fusing both gyroscope and accelerometer values by using a complimentry filter.

# Result
