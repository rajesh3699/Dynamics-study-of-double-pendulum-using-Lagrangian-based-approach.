# Dynamic study of double pendulum using Lagrangian based approach.
The inspiration behind this was to learn Lagrangian, using the former derive dynamic model of double pendulum and simulate it.

# Derivation of dynamics
The derivation of the dynamics is [linked here](Snake dynamics lagrangian approach (1).pdf
)

# Future work
Solving the differential equations using various iterative numerical methods and thereby comparing results by simulating.
